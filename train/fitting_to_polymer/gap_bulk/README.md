This directory contains the data and script used to compare bulk polymer band gaps and monomer HOMO-LUMO gaps.

#### 1. `./data/Egb.csv`
Contains bulk polymer band gaps computed using DFT under periodic boundary conditions.

#### 2. `./pred/AL3_test_pred_total_merged.csv`
Contains monomer HOMO-LUMO gap predictions from the neural network model reported in previous work (https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2025/sc/d4sc08617a).

#### 3. `./SI_figure.py`
Generates a plot showing the correlation between polymer band gaps and monomer HOMO-LUMO gaps.
